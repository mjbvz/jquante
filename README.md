# JQuante #

JQuante is a baic Java QM toolkit that was inspired by PyQuante, written in Java. 

Having started off attempting to port the Python PyQuante code to Java, it was soon discovered that some of the PyQuante code had been ported by V. Ganesh in his [Metastudio](https://github.com/tovganesh/metastudio) project. V. Ganesh, re-licensed this code base to a MIT license, hence this can be used here.

The code aims to:

* Provide a basic set of Java QM methods
* Provide associated unit tests
* Packaged within a Maven framework
